1
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,570
We have arrived(到达) at the dawn(黎明) of a new era.

2
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,910
We will face the unknown together.

3
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,230
I don't know what it is,

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,790
but there's plenty of people out here trying(尝试) to figure it out.

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,210
You know I've(我不知道) got your back.

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,620
Damn(该死) well better, I'm your captain.

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,040
We have to work together.

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,290
For the good of the new Belter state.

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,800
Detective Miller(米勒) crashed(崩溃) into Venus(金星).

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,590
I'm just an investigator(调查员) now.

11
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,510
I find things.

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,640
Couple hundred billion brain cells(细胞) in your skull.

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,300
When I push a few trillion(万亿) of them buttons(按钮)

14
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,800
in exactly the right way, you're talking(说话) to Miller.

15
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,340
Miller(米勒) showed(显示) me things.

16
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,020
A whole civilization.

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,510
They made(创造) the station, this space.

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,480
Something killed(杀死) them. They tried(尝试) to stop it.

19
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,430
Burned(烧焦了) whole solar systems.

20
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,350
Only, it didn't work.

21
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,570
When we detonated(引爆) our bomb,

22
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,030
I believe we became(成为) the threat.

23
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,530
We taught(教) the station that our ships(船舶) are fusion(聚变) bombs.

24
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,830
We need to shut down every reactor(反应堆) in the flotilla(舰队).

25
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,830
That station is gonna(要) wipe us all out,

26
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,080
unless we make this happen now.

27
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,410
Together till the end?

28
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,920
We're on the brink(边缘) right now

29
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,050
because we keep reacting(反应) to things(事情) we don't understand!

30
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,460
And we're reaching(达到) for violence

31
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,260
because we can't figure out what to do.

32
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,330
Don't shoot!

33
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,130
Fuck.

34
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,170
You've given us a new frontier,

35
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,980
1,300 habitable(可居住) systems(系统) on the other side of those rings.

36
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,600
It's gonna(要) be another blood-soaked gold rush.

37
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,360
The civilization(文明) that built(建造) the rings(戒指) is gone, wiped(擦) out.

38
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,530
What could have killed(杀死) them?

39
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,310
That's(没错) what I'd like to know.

40
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,730
Gonna need a ride.

41
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,450
Unidentified(身份不明) Belter ships,

42
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,990
you are entering(进入) restricted(限制) space.

43
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,910
Veer(转向) off now, or we will fire!

44
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,670
Barbapiccola, this is the UNN(联合国新闻网) Tripoli.

45
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,960
Shut down your drive now, or we will fire.

46
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,670
Respond immediately.

47
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,720
We are unarmed. This is a refugee ship.

48
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,180
Mama, I'm scared.

49
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,220
Whatever happens, we will be together.

50
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,010
Together.

51
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,230
Tripoli, you are not authorized(授权的) to fire inside the Ring Space.

52
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,450
Barbapiccola, the OPA orders(命令) you to comply.

53
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,450
We will not.

54
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,290
We've(我们已经) been(一直) begging(乞求) for a port since Ganymede(木卫三) fell.

55
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,370
No one would let us land.

56
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,910
If you're going to kill us,

57
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,750
just do it now, or let us go!

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,870
Go.

59
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,210
Go! Go! Go!

60
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,930
Go! Go! Go!

61
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,220
Go! Go! Go!

62
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,010
Go! Go! Go!

63
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,280
Now, that's(没错) a good cup of coffee.

64
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,910
Did you speak to Naomi?

65
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,880
It was lovely meeting her,

66
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,700
except it was through a screen.

67
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,340
It's such a shame she couldn't(不能) come down and see the farm.

68
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,010
Mom...

69
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,040
That was a long trip you were on.

70
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,920
She could have taken(采取) those gravity(重力) drugs(药物) on the way.

71
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,630
It's not that easy.

72
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,020
Those drugs(毒品) are brutal.

73
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,180
I wouldn't(不会) have asked(问) her to do that for me.(我。)

74
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,310
And this isn't(不是) her home.

75
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,600
Most Belters have mixed(混合的) feelings(感情) about Earth.

76
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,780
Here.

77
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,110
It's for your next long haul.

78
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,870
Think I need to reread(重读) this?

79
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,380
What did you see out there?

80
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,010
It's hard to put into words.

81
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,270
Storm's coming.

82
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,980
I'm gonna(要) go close up the house.

83
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,520
I'll be right in.(在。)

84
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,900
Gonna be a real turd-floater, huh?

85
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,830
Perfect words(文字) for every occasion.

86
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,000
We gotta(得走了) talk about that ride.

87
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,830
The ride? Yeah, I know.

88
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,210
Next clue(线索) to the case.

89
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,250
We're leaving(离开) tomorrow.

90
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,630
Are(是吗) we going to the Ring?

91
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,310
We're going to New York.

92
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,680
What the hell's in New York?

93
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,180
Tall buildings, good pizza,

94
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,150
Secretary-General(秘书长,) of the United Nations,

95
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,970
- who summoned(召唤) me.(我。) - So you can ask her,

96
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,480
tell her to let you go through the Ring.

97
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,940
I have, a hundred times.

98
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,610
I'll bring it up again,

99
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,070
but something must have changed(变化) if she wants(想要) to talk.

100
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,030
We gotta(得走了) talk about that ride, kid.

101
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,490
Next clue(线索) to the case.

102
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,370
I wonder what that rain tastes(味道) like.

103
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,790
I used to love the rain when I was a kid.

104
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,760
I'd sit out here and watch the lightning(闪电) storms.

105
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,760
Sounds(声音) beautiful.

106
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,310
We gotta(得走了) talk about that ride, kid.

107
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,430
Next clue(线索) to the case.

108
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,060
You got it, Miller. I'll take care of it.

109
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,660
I hope we get a chance to meet in person one day.

110
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,110
You know, I'm quite a dancer.

111
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,030
Holden(霍尔顿) never stops(停止) saying.

112
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,340
Fong(方先生) kopenga tolwanda ert(电化学反应堆) el(埃尔) Belte

113
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,090
fong(方) kopenga tolowabda Ert.

114
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,710
Okay, okay, okay.

115
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,090
Bye, now. Bye!

116
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,840
Bye-bye!(再见) Bye! Take care!

117
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,590
That was agonizing.

118
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,300
Yes, it was.

119
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,220
I'll see you soon.

120
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:01,640
Love you.

121
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,930
New railgun's looking(看) good.

122
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,480
I just need you to check out the thrust(推力) compensator(补偿器).

123
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,740
If thing's not tied(并列) into our drive just right,

124
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,200
we're all gonna(要) get tossed(投掷) into the ceiling(天花板) every time it fires(开火).

125
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,320
I'm on it.

126
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,990
Hey, Amos.

127
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,080
Melba?

128
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,960
Please, Clarissa.

129
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,960
I get one vid(视频) message a month now.

130
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,090
I...

131
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,180
didn't have anyone to call.

132
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,890
- Okay. - So you coming(来了) down the well?

133
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,810
Nope.

134
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,480
Not even to feel the surf(海浪) through your toes?

135
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,110
There's(有的) a lot of past in my past.(过去。)

136
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,350
I'm gonna(要) skip(跳过) it.

137
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,690
At least you have the choice.

138
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,400
I'm gonna(要) spend the rest of my life in here.

139
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,990
Like Dad.

140
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,070
Yeah, they really threw(扔) the book at you.

141
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,030
I called(叫) to say thank you.

142
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,570
For what?(什么？)

143
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,700
The months(月) heading(航向) home,

144
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,870
letting(让) me work in the shop with you,

145
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,750
- it kept(保持) me sane. - You're a good mechanic.

146
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,790
I've(我不知道) been(一直) thinking about something.

147
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,960
Remember when you sent(发送) me to check on the...

148
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,760
the seals(封印) in the air lock?

149
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:22,680
Yep.

150
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,640
The safeties(安全) had been(一直) overridden, and...

151
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,760
if I wanted(需要) to, I could have blown(吹) the outer(外部的) door

152
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,060
while I was in it, killed(杀死) myself.

153
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,310
Yep.

154
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,890
Was(曾经是) that on purpose?

155
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,860
If I was staring(凝视) down a lifetime sentence,

156
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,440
I'd want to have the option.

157
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,450
It was kind of you to make the offer.

158
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,320
But Anna was right. I...

159
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,620
- I don't deserve the easy way out. - Stop it.

160
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,250
You breathe in, you breathe out,

161
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,720
eat, shit, sleep,

162
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,250
you take whatever they give you,

163
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,130
and you give nothing in return.

164
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,810
I have to go.

165
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,980
They have me doing dream therapy.

166
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,850
I don't really understand it, but...

167
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,950
the doctor has flowers(花) in her office,

168
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,980
and I can smell them through the glass.

169
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,360
Good luck with that.

170
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,280
Can I bother you again sometime?

171
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,820
Sure thing, Peaches.

172
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,420
What I want is more ships(船舶) at the Ring blockade.

173
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,300
All I need from you is to make that happen.

174
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,100
Our assets(资产) in the outer(在外) planets(行星) have been(一直) decimated.

175
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,100
We don't have the ships.

176
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,260
We could redeploy(重新部署) elements(元素) of the Home Fleet.

177
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,470
You forgot(忘记) about Mars?

178
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,310
It's a new day. We're all friends(朋友) now.

179
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,190
Madam(女士) Secretary, if I may...

180
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,650
Nancy, don't start this shit(该死) with me again.

181
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,610
Half our population is unemployed(失业),

182
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,570
and we've(我们已经) been(一直) given the biggest(最大的) opportunity(机会)

183
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:03,820
to give them jobs, to give them a purpose in a century.

184
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,160
Every week, another colony(殖民地) ship filled(装满) with our constituents(选民)

185
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,080
shows(显示) up at the blockade, and we make them wait.

186
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,790
They're(他们是) sitting(坐) ducks(鸭子) for pirates(海盗).

187
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,080
They want to explore new worlds.

188
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:12,960
We should let them.

189
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,500
When Columbus(哥伦布) arrived,

190
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,460
at least he knew(知道) what was waving(挥手) at him was human.

191
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,880
We've(我们已经) sent(发送) out hundreds(数百) of probes(探测器) through the Rings.

192
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,930
Not one of them has turned(转动) up any little green men.

193
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,550
You haven't seen(看到) it yet, so it doesn't exist.

194
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,800
That's(没错) your argument?

195
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,930
You can't control a goddamn(该死的) gold rush.

196
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,510
When the stacks(堆) of body bags(袋) came(来) back from the Yukon,

197
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,980
thousands(数千) of hopeful(希望的) idiots(白痴)

198
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,570
lined(衬里) up to be the next corpses.

199
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,860
The only reason there weren't any riots(暴乱) in the streets(街道)

200
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,450
when we fired(解雇) on the Ganymede(木卫三) ships(船舶)

201
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,910
was because they were Belters.

202
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:45,480
Sooner(更快) or later, an Earth ship will try to run the blockade.

203
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,700
Are(是吗) you going to shoot down our own citizens,

204
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,000
or are we gonna(要) turn this situation to our advantage?

205
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,960
We are going to do what I goddamn(该死的) said(说)

206
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,280
we are going to do...

207
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,450
So do it.

208
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,840
Are(是吗) you familiar with the Barbapiccola?

209
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,800
Refugee ship from Ganymede(木卫三).

210
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,940
One of the four that slipped(滑倒) through the Ring

211
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,470
before the blockade(封锁) went up.

212
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,220
They were never heard(听到) from again.

213
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,230
We heard(听到) from them again.

214
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,030
The Belters have been(一直) installing(安装) comm relays(通信中继器)

215
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,480
through the Ring gates,

216
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,320
prioritizing(优先) those four systems.

217
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,740
The relays(继电器) went live two days(日) ago

218
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,030
and started(开始) picking(采摘) up broadcasts(广播) from one system.

219
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,520
By some miracle,

220
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,750
the Belters on this world survived.

221
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,330
About a hundred or so.

222
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,910
They're calling(呼叫) the planet Ilus.

223
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,910
Makes(制造) sense.

224
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,290
Ilus was a brother of Ganymede(木卫三).

225
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,470
Who gives(给) a fuck?

226
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,920
I didn't bring you here to teach me mythology(神话学).

227
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,770
The planet is practically(实际上) made(成的) of lithium(锂).

228
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,010
They're mining(采矿) it.

229
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,940
Belters struck(击中) it rich. Good for them.

230
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,470
They also found this.

231
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:01,600
That looks(看) like the work of the protomolecule.

232
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,030
Doesn't appear to be active.

233
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,510
And for a few hundred years, we thought

234
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:15,780
Phoebe(菲比) was just a ball of ice orbiting(轨道) Saturn(土星).

235
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,830
I want you to go to Ilus.

236
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,550
Are(是吗) you still talking(说话) to Miller?

237
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,340
It's more like he talks(会谈) to me.(我。)

238
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,390
You said(说) the worlds(世界) on the other side

239
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,930
of those Rings(戒指) were killed...

240
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,600
genocide(种族灭绝) on a scale

241
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,470
that we cannot(无法) even begin to comprehend(理解).

242
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,480
You have the insight to the protomolecule

243
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,310
that no one else does.

244
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,810
I need to know what is really going on over there.

245
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,890
Is Ilus a ghost(鬼魂) town

246
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,940
or another fucking Eros?

247
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,820
And if it is another Eros?

248
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,700
Evacuate(撤离) the Belters,

249
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,570
destroy the protomolecule if you can,

250
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,700
and get the hell out of there.

251
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,900
Nice of Avasarala to clear up our salvage(打捞) claim.

252
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,610
- How'd she look? - Fine.

253
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,070
No, I mean, like,

254
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,650
what was she wearing?

255
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,280
It's good to be home.

256
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,950
Avasarala's worried it could become another Eros.

257
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,820
If Miller's right, it could be something much worse.

258
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,160
She already has a ship en route,

259
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,210
the Edward Israel.

260
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:44,080
It's a science ship, survey vessel out of Titan.

261
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,870
A warship's more her style. That's(没错) for sure.

262
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,000
It's not a military operation.

263
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,800
They've got the gear and the expertise(知识) to assess the situation

264
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,640
and hopefully(希望) contain any contamination(污染).

265
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,260
We'll have access to their resources(资源) if we need them.

266
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,850
Look, I opened(打开) those gates.

267
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,040
So I'm responsible(负责)

268
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,980
if anything comes(来) through them.

269
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,060
We all opened(打开) those gates.

270
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,520
All right.

271
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,690
At Ilus,

272
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,330
Amos and I will transfer to the Edward Israel

273
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,950
and take their shuttle(穿梭机) down to the surface.

274
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,700
Naomi, you and Alex(亚历克斯) will stay in orbit(轨道) on the Roci...

275
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,780
I'm going to the surface too.

276
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,370
Are(是吗) you sure?

277
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,950
It's a long trip to Ilus.

278
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,330
I'll(我会) have time to prepare.

279
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,930
There's(有的) 1,300 new systems(系统) out there,

280
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,960
and I don't want to see them all from orbit.

281
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,140
All right, then, in which case,

282
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,480
we're gonna(要) need to rig(钻机) the Roci for an unassisted(助的) landing(着陆).

283
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,680
- I know a guy on Luna. - Give him a call.

284
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,230
So this guy does MCRN retrofits(加装)?

285
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,060
Uh-huh, works cheap and fast, doesn't ask questions.

286
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,440
Naomi...

287
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,410
Whatever happens(发生) down there,

288
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,200
we'll deal with it together.

289
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,560
Arriving(到了) at Innis(女名女子名) Shallows(浅滩) Station.

290
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,050
Stand clear of the doors.

291
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,030
Civilian Accountability(问责制) Committee

292
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:22,120
reminds(提醒) all citizens(市民) that your quarterly(季度) action report

293
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,620
is due in two weeks.

294
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,710
The assistance desk is open for 24 hours(小时) and 2/3

295
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,740
for your questions(问题) and concerns.

296
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,330
Don't miss your deadline.

297
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,750
Mars(火星) is better for everyone when everyone does(工作) their part.

298
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,890
Bobbie.

299
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,480
See you, Rana.

300
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,700
Hey, I got a few bites(咬) on apartments,

301
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,360
so I shouldn't(应该) be too much longer.

302
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,190
As long as you need, Bobbie.

303
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,360
I'm gonna(要) shower(淋浴) and head out for a pop.

304
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,540
Keep an eye out for David?

305
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,450
Sure.

306
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,720
Hey, sit down. Stay a while.

307
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,800
Can't. Got a study date.

308
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,150
Huh. Pretty good. Thank you.

309
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,430
Yeah, I can really heat 'em up.

310
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:36,900
Shit, she's(她是) early.

311
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,860
Hey, Leelee. Let me get my stuff.

312
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,910
Hey?

313
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,240
You're Aunt Bobbie.

314
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,170
David talks(会谈) about you all the time.

315
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,750
He says(说) you're a war hero.

316
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,160
He's(他是) a sweet kid.

317
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,210
Uh, you ready?

318
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,790
It's nice to meet you.

319
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,890
Hey, Bobbie.

320
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,560
Nice to see you, flyboy.

321
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,070
I'm just passing(传递) through the neighborhood(邻居),

322
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,890
thought I'd check in live for a change.

323
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:18,560
How you doing?

324
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,270
- Getting(获得) by. - Oh, yeah?

325
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,230
I saw(锯) the news you're heading(航向) to the Ring.

326
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,860
Are(是吗) you going to New Terra?

327
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,570
I can neither confirm nor deny that.

328
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,120
There's(有的) protomolecule down there.

329
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,080
Yeah, so it would appear.

330
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,170
Apparently(显然) we are experts(专家) in the field,

331
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,870
so who better to go and see for sure, right?

332
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,050
And how are you feeling about it?

333
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,550
You wouldn't(不会) understand.

334
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,040
What's(什么事) that supposed to mean?

335
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,180
You've never been(一直) scared(害怕) of anything in your life.

336
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,640
Sure, I have. All the time.

337
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,850
But there's a trick.

338
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,450
You just have to believe

339
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,440
that what you're doing really matters,

340
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,990
and then the fear can't control you.

341
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,580
Oh, shit. Delay's getting(得到) bad.

342
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,570
Shit.

343
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,700
Take care of yourself, flyboy.

344
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,910
You too, Bobbie.

345
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,060
UN freighter Amberjack,

346
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,470
we got you target lock.

347
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,680
Give us cargo. We no fight and you live.

348
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,800
Answer now.

349
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,690
Unidentified(a.) pirata, this is O.P.A.S. Tynan.

350
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,770
We have target lock.

351
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:47,530
Shut down your drive. Prepare to be boarded.

352
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,610
Comply, or we will be forced(被迫) to fire.

353
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,240
You rabbiting, bossmang.

354
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,790
Fo(男名男子名) da(爸爸) shasa.

355
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,930
Ready the grapple.

356
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,900
Radiation(辐射) spiking.

357
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,060
Evasive(规避) action!

358
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,470
They're dumping(倾倒) core!

359
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,190
What faction(派别) are you with?

360
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,980
It pay well?

361
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,820
Fo(男名男子名) kill your own...

362
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,780
fo da(爸爸) Inners?

363
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,910
Three UN supply ships(船舶) got hit on this trade route

364
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,110
in one month.

365
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,830
Who is ignoring(忽视) the truce?

366
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,520
The one that still fight for the Belt.

367
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,190
Guess you the Inners' good little koyo now.

368
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,870
Content for the table scraps.

369
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,860
They keep Belters out of the Ring

370
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,470
so they find the gold first,

371
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,980
leave us with dirt.

372
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,320
And you help them.

373
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:35,550
Good little koyo.

374
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,230
Rocinante, you are entering(进入) the Ring Blockade(封锁) Zone.

375
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,500
Please transmit(传送) your access code.

376
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,880
Roger that.

377
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,260
There you go, partner.

378
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,790
Code received(接收) and verified.

379
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,360
You're clear for transit.

380
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,570
It's nice to know Martians(火星人)

381
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,410
have to go through this as well.

382
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,890
Yeah, but they get to train for years(年) in one G.(G.)

383
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,710
- How am I doing? - Good.

384
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,420
Bone density, muscle mass, heart-lung(心肺) capacity all up.

385
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,950
They send a mining(采矿) company

386
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,270
- under the name of science... - You need a break?

387
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,440
...to steal our land,

388
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,340
the legitimate(合法) claim of our people.

389
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,910
They call Belters terrorists(恐怖分子)

390
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,480
to strip us of our rights.

391
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,360
We all lost family on Ganymede(木卫三)

392
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,070
because of the Inners' war.

393
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,290
- Yeah. - Ilus is(现在) our home now,

394
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,770
and we will not be driven(驱动) out again.

395
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,820
Yeah.

396
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,690
Keep going.

397
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,600
Oye, Nagata.

398
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,250
What are you doing here?

399
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,280
Is the universe about to end again?

400
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,730
Did you think I'd miss a chance

401
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,400
to talk to you in real time?

402
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,550
Good to see you, kopeng.

403
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,900
A bit of a surprise to be seen.

404
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,670
The Inners don't shoot us to pieces(碎片) with their railguns.

405
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,530
We don't nuke(核武器) the Ring.

406
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,630
One big happy family now, I guess.

407
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,060
You've been(一直) busy, eh?

408
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,170
Over 40(40) Ring comm(通信) relays(继电器) installed(安装) to date, I gather.

409
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:57,900
Forty-two, which means only 1,331 to go.

410
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,590
With Medina(麦地那) Station the hub(中心) of it all.

411
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,990
It's a good command.

412
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,600
Only gas station on the new frontier.

413
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,380
We're putting(推杆) in a souvenir(纪念品) shop.

414
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,730
Be a lot of business after the blockade(封锁) lifts.

415
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:16,220
- How is your back? - Only hurts(伤害) when I move.

416
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,100
Which means nerves(神经) are regrowing, so that's(没错) good.

417
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,410
You're bound for Ilus.

418
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,790
That's(没错) right.

419
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:27,180
With James Holden(霍尔顿) on the gunship.

420
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:30,250
You're going to get the Belters off that planet.

421
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,690
We're not going to evict(驱逐) anyone.

422
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,340
We're going to make sure it's safe.

423
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,510
Safe?

424
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,380
You hear how many of those refugees(难民)

425
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,440
died(死亡) trying(尝试) to adapt?

426
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,270
A lot of them had to go back up to orbit.

427
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:46,100
They were foolish(愚蠢) to think they could live there.

428
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,710
It's not foolish(愚蠢) to want free air

429
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,650
and free water and a home for their children.

430
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,400
We are creatures(生物) of space.

431
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,030
In two generations, their children(孩子) will be Inners.

432
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,570
They won't(不会) even remember what they were.

433
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,720
Everyone should have the right to decide for themselves.

434
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,110
Of course.

435
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,680
Xalte to sif, Camina.

436
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,310
Dewe(德威) fasi, Nagata.

437
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,680
We won't(不会) be able to assess how badly the Belters

438
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,220
have contaminated(污染) the atmosphere(大气)

439
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,120
until we've(我们已经) actually been(一直) on the planet,

440
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,350
but once you're there, I'm hoping(希望) we can

441
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:33,080
convince them of the need to limit the damage.

442
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,990
I'm looking(看) forward to working with you, Captain.

443
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,740
We'll see you on New Terra.

444
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,340
We're through the Ring.

445
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,660
Be on Ilus in a few weeks. Then what?(什么？)

446
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,310
I'll(我会) let you know.

447
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,250
Thanks for the ride.

448
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,800
What...what are we supposed... Wait!

449
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,780
Got something you want to say to me, sailor?

450
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:14,480
Can I...

451
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,050
Can I buy you another beer?

452
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,700
Got RIF'd about six months(月) back.

453
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,040
They told(告诉) our whole unit, "Hey, thanks for the memories.

454
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,450
You're all civilians(平民) now."

455
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,880
Had a promotion(推广) coming(来了) up too.

456
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,810
That's(没错) the shit(该死) end of the stick.

457
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,400
You should know.

458
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,910
I watched(观察) your hearing on the feed.

459
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,580
You could've saved(保存) your benefits(福利) if you signed(签字的)

460
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,490
that statement they were waving(挥手) in front of you.

461
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,090
I'm sure it was good entertainment(娱乐).

462
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:46,170
- But you wouldn't. - I stand by what I did,

463
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,840
and I can live with the fallout.

464
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,860
That's(没错) what a Marine does.

465
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,610
First they order you to lie.

466
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,870
Then they strip you of your pension,

467
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,800
your skin, when you put honor first.

468
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,630
And he doesn't bitch(婊子) and whine(哀号) when the chips(薯条) are down.

469
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,800
He goes to the VA, gets(得到) a regular job...

470
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,900
I'm there every goddamn(该死的) day waiting(等待) in line.

471
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,370
The problem is, you've(你有) got too much time to think.

472
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,340
It's making(制造) you crazy.

473
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,110
Crazy?

474
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,670
Me crazy?

475
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,120
You look like you're about ready to vent(发泄)

476
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,280
someone's skull(颅骨) for looking(看) at you the wrong way.

477
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,740
You're not exactly the poster(海报) girl for mental health.

478
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,230
I didn't vent(发泄) yours.

479
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:18,120
Oh, bleeding(流血) heart.

480
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,960
Let me ask you something.

481
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,610
You were inside that Ring station.

482
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,720
What did you see?

483
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,830
Nothing that would make sense,

484
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,890
except a bunch of people killing(杀) each other

485
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,480
to control something they didn't even understand.

486
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,960
Tell you what, sailor.

487
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,420
Hang on to that uniform. Keep in tip-top.

488
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,950
You can be damn(该死的) sure there are plenty more wars(战争) coming.

489
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,140
Beltalowda would be wise to ask,

490
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,340
if now we kill our own on order of the Inners,

491
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,730
is this peace worth the price?

492
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,210
The OPA does not speak for all.

493
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:11,470
And those who stand with Fred(弗雷德) Johnson

494
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,800
and Anderson(安德森) Dawes(道斯) should bear in mind

495
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,510
the inevitable(必然) fate of wellwalla and collaborators(合作者).

496
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,920
Tynan, you're entering(进入) the Ring Blockade(封锁) Zone.

497
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,010
Please transmit(传送) your access code.

498
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,860
Tynan, no entry to the Ring is permitted(允许的)

499
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,990
without proper authorization(授权).

500
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,720
Transmit(传输) your access code immediately.

501
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,430
Bossmang, they target-lock us.

502
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,630
Tynan, this is your final warning.

503
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,900
Ah, give it to them.

504
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,410
Code verified.

505
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:46,340
Tynan, you're cleared(清除) for the Ring.

506
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,770
- Ashford. - What?(什么？)

507
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:55,880
We have enough problems(问题) already

508
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,520
without you agitating(搅动) the Inners.

509
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,580
Well, they like humiliating(羞辱的) us.

510
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,460
It's bad enough I have to play cop(警察) to protect their haulers.

511
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,870
- We have a treaty(条约). - Worth what to the Belt?

512
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,860
We'll find out, keya? You have to trust your gut.

513
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,310
Well, the last time I did that,

514
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,180
it didn't work out so well, did it?

515
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,930
We were all flying(飞行) blind, Pampaw.

516
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,880
Yeah, well, me more than you.

517
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,830
Only because my friend had a boyfriend(男朋友)

518
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,370
with an imaginary(想象的) friend

519
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,810
who told(告诉) us how to power that station down.

520
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,790
And I thought he was a madman.

521
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:25,090
But he...he turns(转弯) out to be a prophet.

522
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,710
It's possible to be both.

523
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,970
Why'd I let you talk me into this?

524
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:15,790
Are(是吗) you kidding?

525
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,090
First scientists(科学家) ever to study a whole new biome.

526
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,050
We're making(制造) history.

527
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,090
Maybe you will.

528
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,630
This planet has no geological(地质) activity.

529
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,620
And isn't(不是) that amazing?

530
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,840
I was with the Hygeia(女名女子名) group

531
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,930
when we found some Belters

532
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,420
squatting(蹲) on a rock with a billion in platinum(白金) ore(矿石)

533
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,510
- that we had the charter(租船合同) for. - How'd that go?

534
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,250
We gave(给) them a percentage(百分比) of the take, 300K,

535
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,080
topped(顶端) off their water tanks, sent(发送) them on their way.

536
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,020
You got off cheap.

537
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,830
Yeah, the company called(叫) it a win.

538
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,240
Well, let's(让我们) hope it's that easy here.

539
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,050
Yeah, we've(我们已经) got a legal charter(宪章) from the UN and Mars, so...

540
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,250
You think the OPA(管理局) give a shit(该死) about that?

541
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,460
No, I do not.

542
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,730
Lighten(放轻松) up, Fayez.

543
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,450
You're about to be famous.

544
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,910
Bet the rocks(岩石) down here look just like the ones(一个) back home.

545
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,100
Well, I'll name a new bug(虫子) after you.

546
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,430
Hold tight!

547
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,530
There's(有的) one over here!

548
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:52,890
Give me the mask!

549
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,260
It's okay. Come here.

550
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,930
Twenty-three(二十三) of our people are dead,

551
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:09,310
including the mission commander

552
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:11,100
and the ship's physician.

553
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,260
The heavy lift shuttle(穿梭) was destroyed,

554
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,070
along with most of the expedition's(远征) supplies.

555
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,110
Security Chief Murtry refused(拒绝) evacuation(疏散)

556
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:22,270
and is(现在) now in operational(操作的) command of the expedition(远征).

557
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:25,200
Cause of the crash is currently unknown.

558
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,280
The Belters are providing(提供) what aid they can

559
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,420
but hasten(催促) to add the company had no right

560
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,270
to land in the first place.

561
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,920
It could have been(一直) an accident or attack

562
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,610
or something much worse.

563
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:40,120
The story is already metastasizing(转移) on newsfeeds.

564
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,020
Just get yourself to Ilus, do your job,

565
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,120
and let RCE do theirs.

566
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,090
The Belters will try to enlist(争取) you to their cause.

567
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,960
Holden, do not put your dick(鸡巴) in it.

568
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,990
It's fucked enough already.

569
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,090
It's good advice.

570
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,900
Cap, test fire lined(衬里) up.

571
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,400
Fire at will.

572
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,600
Take that, blue goo.

573
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,300
Belte hero.

574
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,860
You na(好吧) kang(康) let them take us from our land.

575
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,730
This our home.

576
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:44,860
This our land, huh? This Belter land.

577
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:47,000
Nobody's doing anything to anybody.

578
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,610
We're here to help.

579
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,830
Welcome. Carol(卡罗尔) Chiwewe.

580
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:54,720
I'm the administrator(管理人) of the settlement(殖民地).

581
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,790
- Jim Holden. - Captain Holden.

582
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,930
Chief Murtry. Welcome to New Terra.

583
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:02,890
Come with me.(我。) I'll give you the lay of the land.

584
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:04,050
Good to meet you.

585
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,700
Hey, you here fo help us or help them?

586
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,620
All right, all right, easy there, partner.

587
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:09,220
Traitors!

588
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:11,730
Traitors!

589
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,790
Traitor. Traitor.

590
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,000
Traitor!

591
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:23,250
Everybody put your guns(枪) down now!

592
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,850
- Amos, you too. - Him first.

593
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,050
You've got two seconds.

594
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:28,050
Pashang, you got one.

595
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,650
What the fuck is that?

596
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,540
Take cover!

597
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,240
You okay?

598
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:27,850
Amos.

599
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,920
Son of a bitch.

600
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,190
- Jesus. - What the fuck was that?

601
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:43,510
Hey, you okay?
