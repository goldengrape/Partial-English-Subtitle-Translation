1
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:11,095
We have arrived(到达)
at the dawn of a new era.

2
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:13,806
We will face the unknown
together.

3
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:15,141
I don't know what it is,

4
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:16,392
but there's plenty of people
out here

5
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:17,601
trying(尝试) to figure it out.

6
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:19,103
You know I've got your backIve(伊夫)u know I've got your back.

7
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:20,396
Damn well better,
I'm your captain.

8
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:21,897
We have to work together.

9
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:25,025
For the good of
the new Belter(了) state.

10
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,695
Detective Miller
crashed(崩溃) into Venus.

11
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:29,447
I'm just an investigator now.

12
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:30,781
I find things(事情).

13
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,575
Couple hundred billion
brain cells(细胞) in your skull.

14
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:34,410
When I push a few trillion(万亿)
of them buttons(按钮)

15
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,370
in exactly the right way,
you're talking(说话) to Miller.

16
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,080
Miller showed(显示) me things(事情).

17
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,957
A whole civilization.

18
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:42,501
They made(成) the station,
this space.

19
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:45,379
Something killed them.
They tried(试) to stop it.

20
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,590
Burned(烧焦了) whole solar systems(系).

21
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,008
Only, it didn't work.

22
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:51,510
When we detonated(引爆) our bomb,

23
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,762
I believe
we became(成为) the threat.

24
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:53,971
We taught(教) the station

25
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,556
that our ships(的)
are(的) fusion(聚变) bombs(炸弹).

26
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,600
We need to shut down every
reactor in the flotilla(船队).

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,769
That station is gonna(要)
wipe us all out,

28
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:01,812
unless we make this
happen now.

29
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,022
Together till the end?

30
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:05,065
We're on the brink(边缘) right noWere(的)re on the brink right now

31
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,610
because we keep reacting(反应) to
things we don't understand!

32
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,361
And we're reaching(在)
for violencwere(曾经) we're reaching
for violence

33
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,322
because we can't figure out
what to docant(斜面)ause we can't figure out
what to do.

34
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:12,865
Don't shoot!

35
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:13,741
Fuck(操).

36
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:18,162
You've given us
a new frontier,

37
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:21,874
1,300 habitable(可居住) systems(系统) on
the other side of those rings(环).

38
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:24,502
It's gonna(将) be another
blood-soaked gold rush.

39
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:28,172
The civilization that built(的)
the rings(环) is gone, wiped(的) out.

40
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:29,423
What could have killed them?

41
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,300
That's what
I'd like to know.

42
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,010
Gonna(要) need a ride.

43
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,187
Unidentified
Belter(不) ships(的),

44
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,357
you are(在) entering(进入)
restricted(限制) space.

45
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,277
Veer(转向) off now, or we will fire!

46
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:58,072
Barbapiccola,
this is the UNN( ) Tripoli.

47
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:00,950
Shut down your drive now,
or we will fire.

48
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,410
Respond immediately.

49
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,538
We are(是) unarmed(没有武器).
This is a refugee ship.

50
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,082
Mama(妈妈), I'm scared.

51
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:11,710
Whatever happens(发生),
we will be together.

52
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,962
Together.

53
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:21,220
Tripoli,
you are(的) not authorized(授权)

54
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,972
to fire inside the Ring Space.

55
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:26,016
Barbapiccola, the OPA
orders(命令) you to comply.

56
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,267
We will not.

57
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,727
We've been(一直) begging(乞求)
for a port

58
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,145
since Ganymede(Ganymede) fell.

59
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,480
No one would let us land.

60
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,898
If you're going to kill us,

61
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,526
just do it now, or let us go!

62
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:37,444
Go.

63
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,154
Go! Go!

64
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:42,157
Go! Go! Go!

65
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,535
Go! Go! Go!

66
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:47,329
Go! Go! Go!

67
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,937
Now, that's
a good cup of coffee.

68
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,689
Did(过) you speak to Naomi?

69
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,899
It was lovely meeting her,

70
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,110
except it was through a screen.

71
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,031
It's such a shame she couldn't
come down and see the farm.

72
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:23,282
Mom(妈妈)...

73
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,200
That was a long trip
you were(的) on.

74
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,912
She could have taken(采取) those
gravity drugs(药物) on the way.

75
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,581
It's not that easy.

76
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,082
Those drugs(毒品) are(是) brutal.

77
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,001
I wouldn't have asked(问) her
to do that for me.

78
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,088
And this isn't her homeisnt(不是) this isn't her home.

79
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:41,425
Most Belters(数) have mixed
feelings(感情) about Earth.

80
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,724
Here.

81
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,895
It's for your next long haul.

82
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,941
Think I need to reread(重读) this?

83
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,282
What did(曾经) you see out there?

84
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,540
It's hard to put into words(语).

85
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,297
Storm's comingStorms(暴风雨)'s coming.

86
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:24,968
Mm(嗯).

87
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,096
I'm gonna(要) go
close up the house.

88
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:28,514
I'll be right in.

89
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,185
Gonna(Gonna) be a real
turd-floater, huh?

90
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,731
Perfect words(的)
for every occasion.

91
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,774
Hey.

92
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,153
We gotta(得走了) talk about that ride.

93
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:25,737
The ride?
Yeah, I know.

94
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,031
Next clue to the case.

95
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,952
We're leaving(离开) tomorrowWere(曾经是)re leaving tomorrow.

96
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,662
Are(是吗) we going to the Ring?

97
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,289
We're going to New York.

98
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,665
What the hell's(地狱) in New York?

99
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,877
Tall buildings(的),
good pizza,

100
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:42,045
Secretary-General
of the United Nations(国)SecretaryGeneral(秘书长)al
of the United Nations,

101
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,005
who summoned(召唤) me.

102
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,423
So you can ask her,

103
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:45,382
tell her to let you
go through the Ring.

104
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,718
I have, a hundred times.

105
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:50,012
I'll bring it up again,

106
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:52,097
but something must have changed(变化)
if she wants(想) to talk.

107
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,974
We gotta(得走了) talk
about that ride, kid.

108
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,267
Next clue to the case.

109
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,568
I wonder what that rain
tastes(味) like.

110
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,076
I used to love the rain
when I was a kid.

111
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,871
I'd sit out here and watch
the lightning storms(暴风雨).

112
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,708
Sounds(声音) beautiful.

113
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,838
We gotta(得走了) talk
about that ride, kid.

114
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,590
Next clue to the case.

115
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,093
You got it, Miller.
I'll take care of it.

116
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:37,226
I hope we get a chance
to meet in person one day.

117
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:40,103
You know, I'm quite a dancer.

118
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,648
Holden never stops(停) saying(说).

121
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,696

124
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,577
That was agonizing(痛苦).

125
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,996
Yes, it was.

126
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,624
I'll see you soon.

127
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:01,875
Love you.

128
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,840
New railgun's looking(的) good.

129
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,468
I just need you to check out
the thrust compensator(补偿器).

130
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,804
If thing's not tied
into our drive just rightthings(情),

131
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,180
we're all gonna(要) get
tossed(扔) into the ceiling

132
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,431
every time it fires(火).

133
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,850
I'm on it.

134
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:25,857
Hey, Amos.

135
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,403
Melba?

136
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,947
Please, Clarissa.

137
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:38,078
I get one vid(Vid) message
a month now.

138
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,455
I...

139
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,082
didn't have anyone to call.

140
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:45,168
- Okay.
- So you coming down the well?

141
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,962
Nope(没有).

142
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:50,424
Not even to feel the surf(海浪)
through your toes(脚趾)?

143
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,050
There's a lot of past
in my pastTheres(有)'s a lot of past
in my past.

144
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,260
I'm gonna(要) skip it.

145
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,387
At least you have the choice.

146
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,639
I'm gonna(要) spend the rest
of my life in here.

147
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,141
Like Dad.

148
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:01,184
Yeah, they really
threw(的) the book at you.

149
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,186
I called(叫) to say thank you.

150
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,814
For what?

151
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,858
The months(月) heading home,

152
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,110
letting(让) me work
in the shop with you,

153
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,946
- it kept(保持) me sane(正常的).
- You're a good mechanic.

154
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:17,617
I've been(一直) thinking
about somethingIve(伊夫)ve been thinking
about something.

155
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,203
Remember when you sent(去) me
to check on the...

156
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,371
the seals(密) in the air lock?

157
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,040
Yep.

158
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,334
The safeties(安全)
had(有) been(一直) overridden, and...

159
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,544
if I wanted(的) to, I could have
blown(的) the outer door

160
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,588
while I was in it,
killed myself.

161
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:31,882
Yep.

162
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,967
Was that on purpose?

163
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,762
If I was staring(着) down
a lifetime sentence,

164
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:39,097
I'd want to have the option.

165
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:45,395
It was kind of you
to make the offer.

166
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:48,106
But Anna was right. I...

167
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,566
I don't deserve
the easy way out.

168
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,734
Stop it.

169
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:56,156
You breathe in,
you breathe out,

170
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,657
eat, shit, sleep,

171
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,951
you take whatever
they give you,

172
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,037
and you give nothing in return.

173
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,421
I have to go.

174
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,006
They have me doing
dream therapy.

175
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,175
I don't really
understand it, but...

176
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,010
the doctor has(有) flowers(医)
in her office,

177
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,054
and I can smell them
through the glass.

178
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,098
Good luck with that.

179
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,974
Can I bother you
again sometime?

180
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,645
Sure thing, Peaches(桃).

181
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:40,409
What I want is more ships(的)
at the Ring blockade(封锁).

182
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:43,120
All I need from you
is to make that happen.

183
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,871
Our assets(资产)
in the outer planets(行星)

184
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,289
have been(一直) decimated(灭).

185
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,041
We don't have the ships(船).

186
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,209
We could redeploy(重新部署)
elements(元素) of the Home Fleet.

187
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,794
You forgot(忘记) about Mars?

188
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,796
It's a new day.
We're all friends(友) nowWere(的)s a new day.
We're all friends now.

189
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,840
Madam(女士) Secretary, if I may...

190
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,591
Nancy, don't start
this shit with me again.

191
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,552
Half our population
is unemployed(失业),

192
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,637
and we've been(的) given
the biggest(最大的) opportunity

193
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,807
to give them jobs(工作), to give them
a purpose in a century.

194
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:07,144
Every week, another colony ship
filled(装满) with our constituents(的)

195
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,104
shows(显示) up at the blockade(封锁),
and we make them wait.

196
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:10,647
They're sitting(的) ducks(的)
for pirates(海盗).

197
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:11,940
They want to explore
new worlds(世界).

198
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,983
We should let them.

199
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,526
When Columbus arrived(到达的),

200
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:17,404
at least he knew(的) what was
waving(的) at him(他) was human.

201
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,906
We've sent(过) out hundreds(数百)
of probes(探测器) through the Rings(环).

202
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,033
Not one of them has(现) turned(转动) up
any little green men.

203
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,286
You haven't seen(看到) it yet,
so it doesn't exist.

204
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:26,121
That's your argument?

205
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:28,790
You can't control
a goddamn(该死的) gold rushcant(斜面) can't control
a goddamn gold rush.

206
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,544
When the stacks(堆) of body bags(袋)
came(的) back from the Yukon,

207
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,838
thousands(千) of hopeful(希望的) idiots(白痴)

208
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:36,631
lined(具) up to be
the next corpses(尸体).

209
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,758
The only reason there weren't
any riots(骚乱) in the streets(街)

210
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,343
when we fired( )
on the Ganymede(Ganymede) ships( )

211
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,262
was because they were(曾经) Belters(人).

212
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,640
Sooner or later, an Earth ship
will try to run the blockade(封锁).

213
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,684
Are(的) you going to shoot down
our own citizens(公民),

214
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,686
or are(的) we gonna(要) turn this
situation to our advantage?

215
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,938
We are(的) going to do
what I goddamn(的) said(的)

216
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,482
we are(的) going to do.

217
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,360
So do it.

218
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,622
Are(是吗) you familiar
with the Barbapiccola?

219
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:11,041
Refugee ship from Ganymede(Ganymede).

220
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,834
One of the four that slipped(的)
through the Ring

221
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,503
before the blockade(封锁) went(去) up.

222
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:16,338
They were(曾经) never
heard(听到) from again.

223
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:18,632
We heard(的) from them again.

224
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,926
The Belters(elter) have been(e)
installing(安装) comm relays(el)

225
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,636
through the Ring gates,

226
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:25,597
prioritizing(优先)
those four systems(系统).

227
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,766
The relays(继电器) went(去) live
two days(天) ago

228
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:31,436
and started(开) picking(开) up
broadcasts(广播) from one system.

229
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:34,731
By some miracle, the Belters(的)
on this world survived(幸存).

230
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,858
About a hundred or so.

231
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,402
They're calling(呼叫)
the planet Ilus.

232
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,071
Makes(制造) sense.

233
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,782
Ilus was a brother
of Ganymede(Ganymede).

234
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,492
Who gives(给) a fuck(他妈)?

235
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,953
I didn't bring you here
to teach me mythology(神话).

236
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:50,580
The planet is practically
made(成的) of lithium(锂).

237
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,998
They're mining(采矿) it.

238
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,917
Belters(人) struck(击中) it rich.
Good for them.

239
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,627
They also found this.

240
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,633
That looks(看) like the work
of the protomolecule.

241
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,392
Doesn't appear to be active.

242
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,227
And for a few hundred years(年),

243
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:15,605
we thought Phoebe was just
a ball of ice orbiting(的) Saturn.

244
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,818
I want you to go to Ilus.

245
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,491
Are(在) you still talking(说话)
to Miller?

246
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,326
It's more like he talks(会谈) to me.

247
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,245
You said(的) the worlds(世界)
on the other side

248
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:32,998
of those Rings(的) were(的) killed...

249
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:34,708
genocide(种族灭绝) on a scale

250
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,711
that we cannot(无法) even being
to comprehend(理解).

251
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,380
You have the insight
to the protomolecule

252
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,716
that no one else does(人).

253
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:46,720
I need to know what is really
going on over there.

254
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,223
Is Ilus a ghost town
or another fucking Eros?

255
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,809
And if it is another Eros?

256
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,936
Evacuate(疏散) the Belters(人),

257
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,856
destroy the protomolecule
if you can,

258
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,774
and get the hell out of there.

259
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,714
Nice of Avasarala to clear up
our salvage(打捞) claim.

260
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,424
- How'd she look?
- Fine.

261
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,469
No, I mean, like,
what was she wearing(穿)?

262
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,056
It's good to be home.

263
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,101
Avasarala's worried it could
become another Eros.

264
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:38,104
If Miller's right, it could
be something much worse(的)Millers(的)ler's right, it could
be something much worse.

265
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:41,107
She already has(在) a ship
en route, the Edward Israel.

266
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,777
It's a science ship,
survey vessel out of Titan(泰坦).

267
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,863
- A warship's more her style.
That's for surewarships(战舰)ship's more her style.
That's for sure.

268
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,157
It's not
a military operation.

269
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,992
They've got the gear
and the expertise to assess

270
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,745
the situation and hopefully
contain any contamination(污染).

271
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,456
We'll have access to their
resources(资源) if we need them.

272
00:15:56,456 --> 00:16:00,043
Look, I opened(打开) those gates.

273
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:02,003
So I'm responsible if
anything comes(来) through them.

274
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,255
We all opened(打开) those gates.

275
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,054
All right.

276
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:14,057
At Ilus, Amos and I will
transfer to the Edward Israel

277
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:15,767
and take their shuttle
down to the surface.

278
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,769
Naomi, you and Alex will
stay in orbit on the Roci...

279
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,855
I'm going to the surface too.

280
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,357
Are(是吗) you sure?

281
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,402
It's a long trip to Ilus.

282
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:26,820
I'll have time to prepare.

283
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:31,366
There's 1,300
new systems(系统) out thereTheres(有)'s 1,300
new systems out there,

284
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:34,536
and I don't want
to see them all from orbit.

285
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,329
All right, then,
in which case,

286
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,498
we're gonna(要) need to rig(装) the
Roci for an unassisted(无) landingwere(曾经)re gonna need to rig the
Roci for an unassisted landing.

287
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,750
- I know a guy on Luna.
Give him(他) a call.

288
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,171
So this guy
does(做) MCRN retrofits( 翻新)?

289
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:48,383
Uh-huh, works cheap and
fast, doesn't ask questions(问题)Uhhuh(嗯哼)uh, works cheap and
fast, doesn't ask questions.

290
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,553
Naomi...

291
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:58,268
Whatever happens(发生) down there,
we'll deal with it together.

292

Arriving(达)
at Innis(女名女子名) Shallows( ) Station.

293
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,290
Stand clear of the doors(门).

Civilian

Don't miss
your deadline.

300
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:33,655
Mars is better for everyone
when everyone does(工作) their part.

301
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,133
Bobbie.

302
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,385
See you, Rana.

303
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,638
Hey, I got a few bites(咬)
on apartments(公寓),

304
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,640
so I shouldn't be
too much longer.

305
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,183
As long as you need, Bobbie.

306
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:07,021
I'm gonna(要) shower
and head out for a pop.

307
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,481
Keep an eye out for David?

308
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,482
Sure.

309
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:21,619
Hey, sit down.
Stay awhile(一会儿).

310
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,705
Can't.
Got a study dateCant(斜面)'t.
Got a study date.

311
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,919
Huh. Pretty good.
Thank you.

312
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,713
Yeah, I can really
heat 'em(Em) up.

313
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,051
Shit, she's earlyshes(的)t, she's early.

314
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,808
Hey, Leelee.
Let me get my stuff.

315
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,186
Hey?

316
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,566
You're Aunt Bobbie.

317
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,109
David talks(会谈) about you
all the time.

318
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,444
He says(说) you're a war hero.

He's a sweet kidHes(的)'s a sweet kid.

320
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,281
Uh, you ready?

321
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:01,117
It's nice to meet you.

322
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,501
Hey, Bobbie.

323
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,921
Nice to see you, flyboy(飞).

324
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:15,048
I'm just passing
through the neighborhood,

325
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,216
thought I'd check in live
for a change.

326
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,469
How you doing?

327
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:22,096
- Getting(得) by.
- Oh, yeah?

328
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,098
I saw(去) the news
you're heading to the Ring.

329
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,683
Are(是吗) you going to New Terra(地)?

330
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,895
I can neither confirm
nor deny that.

00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:35,401
Yeah, so it would appear.

333
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,153
Appare(的)ntly we are experts(专家)
in the field,

334
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:40,031
so who better to go
and see for sure, right?

335
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,744
And how are(是) you
feeling about it?

336
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,083
You wouldn't understand.

337
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,127
What's that supposed to mean?

338
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:55,171
You've never been(过) scared
of anything in your life.

339
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,590
Sure, I have.
All the time.

340
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,925
But there's a tricktheres(有)here's a trick.

341
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:02,470
You just have to believe

342
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,764
that what you're doing
really matters(的),

343
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,391
and then the fear
can't control youcant(斜面) then the fear
can't control you.

344
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:07,809
Oh, shit.
Delay's getting(得到) badDelays(延迟)hit.
Delay's getting bad.

345
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:09,060
Shit.

346
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,561
Take care of yourself, flyboy(飞).

347
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:12,814
You too, Bobbie.

348
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,829
UN freighter( )
Amberjack( ),

349
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:29,497
we got you target lock.

350
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,541
Give us cargo.
We no fight and you live.

351
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,959
Answer now.

352
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:43,136
Unidentified pirata,
this is O.P.A.S. TynanOPAS( )dentified pirata,
this is O.P.A.S. Tynan.

353
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,138
We have target lock.

354
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,515
Shut down your drive.
Prepare to be boarded(登上).

355
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:53,312
Comply, or we will be forced(被迫)
to fire.

356
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,732
You rabbiting(兔子), bossmang.

357
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:57,567
Fo da shasa.

358
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,667
Ready the grapple(抓).

359
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,419
Radiation spiking(尖峰).

360
00:22:58,419 --> 00:22:59,837
Evasive(规避) action!

361
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,297
They're dumping(倾倒) core!

362
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:19,649
Supicon.
Someone go out.

363
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,551
What faction are(的) you with?

364
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:48,386
It pay well?

365
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:52,056
Fo kill your own...

366
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,100
fo da Inners(内)?

367
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,769
Three UN supply ships(船)
got hit on this trade route

368
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,312
in one month.

369
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,898
Who is ignoring(忽视) the truce(休战)?

370
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:03,317
The one that still fight
for the Belt.

371
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:08,823
Guess you the Inners(的)'
good little koyo now.

372
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:10,825
Content for the table scraps(残羹剩饭).

373
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,288
They keep Belters(人)
out of the Ring

374
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:17,874
so they find the gold first,

375
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:20,418
leave us with dirt.

376
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:22,253
And you help them.

377
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:35,391
Good little koyo.

378
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,488
Rocinante,
you are(在) entering(进入)

379
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,282
the Ring Blockade(封锁) Zone.

380
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:53,576
Please transmit
your access code.

381
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:54,827
Roger that.

382
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:59,123
There you go, partner.

383
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:00,833
Code received(接收)
and verified(证).

384
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,460
You're clear for transit.

385
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:15,306
It's nice to know Martians(火星人)

386
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:17,433
have to go through
this as well.

387
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:21,395
Yeah, but they get to train
for years( ) in one G.

388
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:25,524
How am I doing?
Good.

389
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:29,362
Bone density, muscle mass,
heart-lung capacity all up.

390
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:31,155
They send
a mining(采矿) company

391
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:32,698
- under the name of science...
- You need a break?

392
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,242
...to steal our land,

393
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:35,868
the legitimate claim
of our people.

394
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,412
They call Belters(的) terrorists(恐怖分子)
to strip us of our rights(权利).

395
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:41,958
We all lost family on Ganymede(Ganymede)
because of the Inners(内)' war.

396
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:44,085
- Yeah.
- Ilus is our home now,

397
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:46,963
and we will not
be driven(去) out again.

398
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,339
Yeah.

399
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:49,674
Keep going.

400
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:24,500
Hmm(嗯).

401
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:28,504
Oye(Oye), Nagata(Nagata).

402
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:30,548
What are(在) you doing here?

403
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:33,342
Is the universe
about to end again?

404
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,802
Did(过) you think
I'd miss a chance

405
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:36,679
to talk to you in real time?

406
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,681
Good to see you, kopeng.

407
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:40,975
A bit of a surprise
to be seen(看到).

408
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:44,395
The Inners(的) don't shoot us
to pieces(片) with their railguns.

409
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:46,355
We don't nuke(核武器攻击) the Ring.

410
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,691
One big happy family now,
I guess.

411
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:50,151
You've been(一直) busy, eh?

412
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:51,902
Over 40(40) Ring comm relays(继电器)

413
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,112
installed(的) to date, I gather.

414
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:57,241
Forty-two,
which means only 1,331

415
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:58,242
to go.

416
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,327
With Medina(麦地那) Station

417
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:00,953
the hub(中心) of it all.

418
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,538
It's a good command.

419
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,875
Only gas station
on the new frontier.

420
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:08,586
We're putting(推杆) in
a souvenir(纪念品) shop

421
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:11,339
Be a lot of business
after the blockade(封锁) lifts(电梯).

422
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:16,260
- How is your back?
- Only hurts( ) when I move.

423
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,971
Which means nerves(神经) are(是)
regrowing(再生), so that's good.

424
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,517
You're bound for Ilus.

425
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:25,061
That's right.

426
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:27,229
With James Holden
on the gunship(武装直升机).

427
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:30,149
You're going to get
the Belters(Belters) off that planet.

428
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,526
We're not going
to evict(驱逐) anyone

429
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,111
We're going to make sure
it's safe

430
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,363
Safe?

431
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:37,239
You hear how many
of those refugees(难民)

432
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,533
died(死) trying(尝试) to adapt?

433
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:42,787
A lot of them had(的) to go
back up to orbit.

434
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:45,956
They were(曾经) foolish to think
they could live there.

435
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:48,459
It's not foolish
to want free air

436
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:51,128
and free water
and a home for their children(孩子).

437
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,298
We are(是) creatures(生物) of space.

438
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:58,052
In two generations(代),
their children(孩子) will be Inners(的).

439
00:27:58,052 --> 00:28:00,471
They won't even remember
what they were(曾经)wont(习惯)y won't even remember
what they were.

440
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:03,265
Everyone should have the right
to decide for themselves.

441
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:05,393
Of course.

442
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,442
Xalte to sif(特), Camina.

443
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,611
Dewe( ) fasi( ), Nagata(Nagata).

444
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,620
We won't be able to assess
how badly the Belterwont(的)won't be able to assess
how badly the Belters(的)

445
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,288
have contaminated(污染)
the atmosphere

446
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:28,165
until we've actually
been(一直) on the planet,

447
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,376
but once you're there,
I'm hoping(希望) we can

448
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:32,878
convince them of the need
to limit the damage.

449
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:35,005
I'm looking(看) forward to working
with you, Captain.

450
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,882
We'll see you on New Terra(地).

451
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:39,278
We're through the RingWere(过)re through the Ring.

452
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,947
Be on Ilus in a few weeks.
Then what?

453
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:43,574
I'll let you know.

454
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:45,326
Thanks for the ride.

455
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:47,453
What...what are(是) we supposed...
Wait!

456
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:10,184
Got something you want
to say to me, sailor(水手)?

457
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:15,272
Can I...

458
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:20,236
Can I buy you another beer?

459
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,199
Got RIF'd about
six months(月) back.

460
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:27,910
They told our whole unit,
"Hey, thanks for the memories(回忆).

461
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,037
You're all civilians(平民) now."

462
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,705
Had(曾经) a promotion coming up too.

463
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:33,916
That's the shit end
of the stick.

464
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,501
You should know.

465
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:38,629
I watched(过) your hearing
on the feed.

466
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:40,506
You could've saved(的)
your benefits(福利) if you signed(签字的)

467
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,508
that statement they were(的)
waving(的) in front of you.

468
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:44,093
I'm sure it was
good entertainment.

469
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:46,136
- But you wouldn't.
- I stand by what I did(的),

470
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:47,513
and I can live
with the fallout(果).

471
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:48,597
That's what a Marine does(的).

472
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,933
First they order you to lie.

473
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,893
Then they strip you
of your pension,

474
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:55,813
your skin,
when you put honor(荣誉) first.

475
00:30:55,813 --> 00:30:58,482
And he doesn't bitch(婊子) and whine(发)
when the chips(薯条) are(在) down.

476
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,484
He goes(人) to the VA,
gets(得到) a regular job...

477
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:03,195
I'm there every goddamn(该死的) day
waiting(等候) in line.

478
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,780
The problem is, you've got
too much time to think.

479
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,990
- It's making(制造) you crazy.

480
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,116
- Crazy?
- Yeah.

481
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:08,826
- Me crazy?
- Mm-hmm.

482
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:10,494
You look like you're
about ready to vent(发泄)

483
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,496
someone's skull for
looking(有) at you the wrong waysomeones(有人)'s skull for
looking at you the wrong way.

484
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:14,707
You're not exactly the
poster girl for mental health.

485
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:16,250
I didn't vent( ) yours.

486
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,168
Oh, bleeding(流血) heart.

487
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:24,800
Let me ask you something.

488
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:27,636
You were(曾经) inside
that Ring station.

489
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,263
What did(曾经) you see?

490
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,895
Nothing that would make sense,

491
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,856
except a bunch of people
killing each other

492
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:41,317
to control something
they didn't even understand.

493
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:43,777
Tell you what, sailor(水手).

494
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:46,363
Hang on to that uniform.
Keep in tip-toptiptop(最)on to that uniform.
Keep in tip-top.

495
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:48,866
You can be damn sure there are(是)
plenty more wars(战争) coming.

496
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:01,629
Beltalowda
would be wise to ask,

497
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:05,007
if now we kill our own
on order of the Inners(内),

498
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:07,468
is this peace
worth the price?

499
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:09,887
The OPA does(有) not
speak for all.

500
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:12,056
And those who stand
with Fred Johnson

501
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:14,433
and Anderson Dawes
should bear in mind

502
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:17,519
the inevitable fate of
wellwalla and collaborators(的).

503
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,813
Tynan, you're entering(进入)
the Ring Blockade(封锁) Zone.

504
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,899
Please transmit
your access code.

505
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:25,778
Tynan, no entry
to the Ring is permitted(允许)

506
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:27,946
without proper authorization(授权).

507
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,157
Transmit your access code
immediately.

508
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,410
Bossmang, they target-lock us.

509
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,375
Tynan, this is
your final warning.

510
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:41,043
Ah, give it to them.

511
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:44,338
Code verified(证).

512
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:45,881
Tynan, you're cleared(清除)
for the Ring.

513
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,223
Ashford.
What?

514
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:55,933
We have enough
problems(的) already

515
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:57,643
without you
agitating(不) the Inners(内部).

516
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:59,687
Well, they like humiliating(羞) us.

517
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:02,231
It's bad enough I have to play
cop(警) to protect their haulers(搬运工).

518
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:04,692
- We have a treaty.
- Worth what to the Belt?

519
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:06,610
We'll find out, keya(凯亚)?
You have to trust your gut(的).

520
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,153
Well, the last time
I did(的) that,

521
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,239
it did(曾经)n't work out so well,
did it?

522
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:11,824
We were(曾经) all flying blind,
Pampaw.

523
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:13,909
Yeah, well,
me more than you.

524
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,744
Only because my friend
had(有) a boyfriend

525
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,413
with an imaginary(想) friend

526
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:19,373
who told us how to power
that station down.

527
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:21,834
And I thought
he was a madman(疯子).

528
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:24,962
But he...he turns(转弯) out
to be a prophet(先知).

529
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:26,505
It's possible to be both.

530
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:13,844
Why'd I let you
talk me into this?

531
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:15,554
Are(是吗) you kidding(玩笑)?

532
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:19,099
First scientists(科学家) ever
to study a whole new biome(生物群落).

533
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,726
We're making(在) historyWere(曾经是)re making history.

534
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,227
Maybe you will.

535
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,437
This planet has(有)
no geological(地质) activity.

536
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:25,063
And isn't that amazingisnt(不是) isn't that amazing?

537
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,857
I was with the Hygeia(亚) group
when we found some Belters(的)

538
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:29,401
squatting(蹲) on a rock
with a billion in platinum(铂) ore(矿)

539
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,487
- that we had(的) the charter for.
- How'd that go?

540
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:34,031
We gave(的) them a percentage
of the take, 300K,

541
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:36,074
topped(的) off their water tanks(的),
sent(的) them on their way.

542
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,326
You got off cheap.

543
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:38,744
Yeah, the company
called(的) it a win.

544
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,496
Well, let's hope
it's that easy herelets(让)l, let's hope
it's that easy here.

545
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:42,915
Yeah, we've got a legal charter
from the UN and Mars, so...

546
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:45,417
You think the OPA(管理局)
give a shit about that?

547
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,377
No, I do not.

548
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,595
Lighten(松) up, Fayez.

549
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,347
You're about to be famous.

550
00:34:58,347 --> 00:35:00,849
Bet the rocks(石) down here look
just like the ones(一个) back home.

551
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:02,601
Well, I'll name a new bug
after you.

552
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:18,367
Hold tight!

553
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,517
There's one over hereTheres(有)'s one over here!

554
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,521
Give me the mask!

555
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:56,942
All right.

556
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,786
Twenty-three
of our people are(人) dead,

557
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,162
including
the mission commander

558
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:11,248
and the ship's physicianships(船)the ship's physician.

559
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:13,166
The heavy lift shuttle
was destroyed(被),

560
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:16,086
along with most
of the expedition's supplies(物).

561
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:18,964
Security Chief Murtry
refused(拒绝) evacuation(撤)

562
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:22,134
and is now in operational
command of the expedition.

563
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:25,220
Cause of the crash
is currently unknown.

564
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,056
The Belters(Belters) are(在)
providing(提供) what aid they can

565
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:30,434
but hasten(赶) to add
the company had(有) no right

566
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:32,310
to land in the first place.

567
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,896
It could have been(一直)
an accident or attack

568
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,732
or something much worse(的事).

569
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:39,985
The story is already
metastasizing(转移) on newsfeeds.

570
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:42,779
Just get yourself to Ilus,
do your job,

571
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,990
and let RCE( ) do theirs(他们的).

572
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,993
The Belters(的) will try
to enlist(取) you to their cause.

573
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:50,829
Holden, do not put
your dick in it.

574
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:53,248
It's fucked enough already.

575
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:56,668
It's good advice.

576
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:07,846
Cap, test fire lined(衬里) up.

577
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:10,098
Fire at will.

578
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:25,363
Take that, blue goo(粘).

579
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:35,382
Belte hero.

580
00:44:35,382 --> 00:44:38,051
You na kang let them take us
from our land.

581
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:39,469
This our home.

582
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:44,724
This our land, huh?
This Belter(的) land.

583
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:46,851
Nobody's doing anything
to anybody.

584
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,728
We're here to helpWere(的)re here to help.

585
00:44:50,397 --> 00:44:52,690
Welcome.
Carol(欢) Chiwewe.

586
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,234
I'm the administrator
of the settlement.

587
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:57,237
- Jim Holden.
Captain Holden.

588
00:44:57,237 --> 00:45:00,740
Chief Murtry.
Welcome to New Terra(地).

589
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,283
Come with me. I'll give you
the lay of the land.

590
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:03,827
Good to meet you.

591
00:45:03,827 --> 00:45:06,955
Hey, you here fo help us
or help them?

592
00:45:06,955 --> 00:45:08,623
All right, all right,
easy there, partner.

593
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,417
Traitors(叛徒)!

594
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:12,168
Traitors(叛徒)!

595
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:15,547
Traitor(叛徒).
Traitor.

596
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:16,923
Traitor(叛徒)!

597
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:19,092
Whoa(哇), whoa(哇)!

598
00:45:20,427 --> 00:45:21,803
Whoa(哇), whoa(哇), whoa.

599
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:23,221
Everybody put
your guns(枪) down now!

600
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,848
- Amos, you too.
- Him(他) first.

601
00:45:24,848 --> 00:45:26,266
You've got two seconds(秒).

602
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:28,726
Pashang, you got one.

603
00:45:40,697 --> 00:45:43,366
What the fuck(操) is that?

604
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:49,873
Take cover!

605
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:02,218
You okay?

606
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:27,911
Amos.

607
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:33,166
Son of a bitch(狗).

608
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:41,132
Jesus.
- What the fuck(操) was that?

609
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:43,092
Hey, you okay?
